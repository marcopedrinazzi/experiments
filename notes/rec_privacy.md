# Survery of Privacy Preserving Collaborative Filtering
**https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08343.pdf**

The use of recommendation systems has grown significantly in recent years. Shopping websites present users with item recommendations based on their history and demographics; movie and book recommendation websites are being used every day to pick new favorites; and online music streaming services generate dynamic playlists to suit each user’s prefer- ences.
Collaborative filtering (CF) is a popular and successful approach to providing user recommendations using knowledge about the user’s preferences and the preferences of other users with similar interests to predict which items the user is most likely to be interested in [1], [2]. There is a large body of literature on CF algorithms [1]–[12], which can be categorized into memory-based and model-based techniques [1], [2].
Since the key point in CF systems relies on users’ pref- erences and past actions to make predictions, many users may feel uneasy because of privacy concerns [13], [14]. Additionally, the need may arise for two or more CF systems to leverage their combined data to provide their users with more accurate recommendations. This type of computation that relies on data from more than one party is referred to as multi- party computation [15]. To leverage this type of computation, the parties need to be able to do it securely, without allowing the other parties to read and store the user data. This is when privacy-preserving data mining techniques [16] become necessary, leading to many different algorithms for privacy- preserving CF (PPCF); e.g: [17]–[24].
